# Mine_or_Rock_Prediction


**Overview**
This project aims to classify geological samples into two categories: "Rock" or "Mine" using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset used for this classification task is the RADOR dataset, which contains features extracted from radar scans of geological samples.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the RADOR dataset, which includes radar data of geological samples. Each sample is labeled as either "Rock" or "Mine". The dataset is available in CSV format and includes various features extracted from the radar scans.

**Google Colab Setup**

To run this project on Google Colab, follow these steps:

**Open Google Colab:**
Go to Google Colab and create a new notebook.

**Upload the Dataset:**
Upload the radar_data.csv file directly into your Colab environment. You can use the file upload feature in Colab.

**Run the Code:**
Run the notebook cells to execute the project code. Ensure that your notebook is set up to read from the uploaded dataset.

**Model I used**

The project uses Logistic Regression for the classification task. The model training process includes:

**Data Preprocessing:**

Loading and cleaning the dataset.
Splitting the data into training and test sets.
Feature scaling and encoding if necessary.

**Model Training:**

Training a Logistic Regression model on the training dataset.
